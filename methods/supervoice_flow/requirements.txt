# TODO: List Python dependencies for Supervoice Flow
torch
torchaudio
einops
accelerate
tqdm
soundfile
torchdiffeq
# textgrid # Might be needed depending on inference implementation
# wandb # Likely optional for inference

# Dependencies based on supervoice-flow train.py and supervoice-enhance README.
# The supervoice-enhance model uses torch.hub, which might automatically download
# required code from ex3ndr/supervoice-enhance and potentially ex3ndr/supervoice-flow.
# Cloning supervoice-flow to lib/ might be redundant, but keeping for reference.

# Need to check Supervoice Enhance repo for additional dependencies
